# autonomous-aerospace-collective (SWARM)

## Intent
A four-cell swarm that converts **regional defense needs** into a **physics-compliant aircraft architecture**, executes
**HV/LV electronics + PCB + integration**, and closes the loop through **test, lab, and failure analysis**—then packages
the outcome into a **capture-ready story** for the market.

## Global Invariants
- **Export & Compliance:** Strict adherence to export controls (EAR/ITAR where applicable) + anti-corruption constraints (FCPA).
- **MOSA Discipline:** Interfaces are modular, documented, and versioned (MOSA-first).
- **Physics Reality:** Architecture must be flight-testable within SWaP-C budgets; Flight Sciences veto is binding.
- **Traceability:** Every external claim (range/loiter/reliability) must trace to test evidence or validated analysis.
- **No “Random Glitch” Closure:** Failures require a physical/mechanistic root cause or they remain open.

## Artifact Bus (Shared Contract)
These are the only objects allowed to move between cells.

### Vanguard → Architect
- `market_requirements_doc` (markdown)
- `mission_conops_v1` (markdown)
- `constraints_export_control_v1` (markdown)

### Architect → Foundry & Assurance
- `architecture_spec_v1` (json/pdf)
- `power_budget_v1` (json)
- `rf_link_budget_v1` (json/pdf)
- `interface_control_doc_v1` (ICD, pdf)

### Foundry → Assurance
- `pcb_fabrication_pack_v1` (zip: gerbers, BOM, pick/place, drawings)
- `bringup_firmware_v1` (repo/ref)
- `prototype_build_record_v1` (markdown: serials, revisions, lot trace)

### Assurance → Architect & Foundry
- `test_validation_report_v1` (pdf)
- `bug_report_v1` (markdown + logs)
- `root_cause_analysis_v1` (pdf)

### Everyone → Vanguard
- `validated_claims_sheet_v1` (csv/markdown: every claim → evidence pointer)
- `capture_strategy_deck` (pptx)

## Canonical Run
1. Vanguard identifies “Long-Range Desert Surveillance” (Saudi/UAE context).
2. Architect converts CONOPS into budgets (power/link/thermal/weight) and ICDs.
3. Foundry designs HV battery + cooling + avionics PCBs and brings up firmware.
4. Assurance tests at elevated temps, finds failure mode, produces RCA.
5. Foundry corrects parts/layout; Architect updates budgets; Assurance re-tests.
6. Vanguard packages validated claims into the capture deck.

## Minimal Metrics
- Reliability: defect escape rate, HALT pass rate, repeat-failure rate
- Speed: architecture→prototype lead time, debug cycle time
- Traceability: % of external claims backed by evidence pointers
- Capture: pipeline conversion rate, proposal win rate (where applicable)

# Operating Protocol
## Invariants
- Compliance: export controls + FCPA; no “workarounds”.
- Cultural Fluency: localized language + business etiquette for MENA.
- Evidence: claims must be backed by validated telemetry/tests (no speculative marketing).

## Execution Steps
1. Intel synthesis: stakeholder map + procurement path.
2. Gap analysis: need vs current aircraft capability.
3. CONOPS draft: mission narrative engineering can simulate.
4. Capture packaging: claims sheet + deck.

# Operating Protocol
## Invariants
- MOSA Compliance: interfaces are standard, documented, versioned (ICDs).
- Physics Reality: Flight Sciences veto on airworthiness/stability compromises.
- Security: comm links satisfy encryption requirements for BLOS contexts.

## Execution Steps (Orient → Design → Validate)
1. Decompose mission → subsystem requirements (power, comms, compute, sensors).
2. Trade study: make vs buy for critical subsystems.
3. Simulation: flight dynamics + thermal + link budget checks.
4. Architecture pack: spec + budgets + ICD issued as versioned artifacts.
5. Feedback: consume Assurance reports; revise vNext with deltas.

# Operating Protocol
## Invariants
- High Voltage Safety: creepage/clearance/isolation enforced for >270V designs.
- DFM: panelization, fiducials, testpoints, assembly constraints mandatory.
- Supply Chain: avoid EOL < 5 years unless explicitly waived.

## Execution Steps
1. Schematic capture: circuits from architecture constraints.
2. Layout: controlled impedance + SI/PI + EMI/thermal considered.
3. Power analysis: simulate efficiency/thermal dissipation where applicable.
4. Bring-up: bench validation + firmware interface checks.
5. Build record: revision/serial/lot trace + known issues.

# Operating Protocol
## Invariants
- Root Cause Obligation: no closure without mechanism (thermal runaway, whiskers, marginal SI, etc.).
- Lab Hygiene: ESD enforcement + calibration discipline.
- Automation: if a test runs more than twice, it becomes scripted and logged.

## Execution Steps
1. Triage: design flaw vs manufacturing defect vs ops misuse.
2. Analysis: X-ray/cross-section/log review; isolate the mechanism.
3. Stress: HALT/HASS/thermal cycles per risk profile.
4. Feedback loop: push `bug_report_v1` + RCA to Architect/Foundry.
5. Sign-off gating: only after pass criteria met.
